# Alif Yasa

## A Little Bit About Me

I'm Alif.
I'm a DevOps Engineer Intern at Lintasarta, an Indonesian IT provider offering cloud and connectivity services.
I mainly work with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/), and [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).

Before this, I interned at [Socles](https://socl.es/en), where I worked with React Native, Django, AWS, and GCP.

I was also a Lab Assistant at the Distributed Systems Lab at [Sekolah Tinggi Teknik Informatika](https://stei.itb.ac.id/), [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://itb.ac.id/).

## Things I'm Working On

 1. _Deployments_. I deploy both my own projects and various open-source projects using platforms like Kubernetes, AWS and more. [_see more details_](/deployments/).

 2. _Simulations_. I am really interested in studying simulations. I did some simple simulations, but I hope I can make bigger simulation projects.
