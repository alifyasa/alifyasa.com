# Architecture of `alifyasa.com`

## Overview

| Component                                               | Description                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)                 | Stores static files                |
| [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) | Content Delivery Network           |
| [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)   | Continuous Deployment to Amazon S3 |

## Basic Workflow

1.  I modify the code.
2.  I push to `main`.
3.  _GitHub Actions_ triggered, built the website and deploy it to S3.
4.  When the CDN cache expires, it will fetch the new one from S3. For now, I can also [manually invalidate it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html), but I'm thinking of a way to automate this.

## How GitHub Actions Deploy to S3

Full code [_here_](https://github.com/alifyasa/alifyasa.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml).
It simply does this:

```
npm install
npm run build
aws login
rclone config
rclone sync
```
